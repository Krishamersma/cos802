## To run the code
- This notebook runs on a local jupyter kernel. 

- Download the dataset at: <br> 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews?resource=download

- Clone the repo locally, and extract the downloaded dataset to the "data" folder of the repository. The repo is public and can be found at: <br>
 https://github.com/Krishamersma/cos802

- There should be two data files included in the download. Only the "Book_ratings.csv" file is used. 

- Click run all to run the full script. It will take a while. The output is saved in an output folder, and then read into a condensed dataframe to plot the results. 

- The plots are generated in the notebook cell outputs
